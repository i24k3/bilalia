I am building an Astro + TailwindCSS website with a **calm, Islamic, spiritually reflective design**.

**Design principles to strictly follow:**

* Minimal, peaceful, respectful (no flashy or loud styles)
* Clear readability hierarchy
* Inspired by Islamic adab, dhikr, Qur’anic reflection
* Soft neutrals (gray, off-white), subtle borders, gentle spacing
* Typography and spacing should invite calm and contemplation

**Hierarchy pattern (very important):**

1. Small, subtle label (optional)
2. Main Arabic dhikr / Qur’anic phrase (primary focus)
3. Visual pause (divider or spacing)
4. English translation or reflection
5. Source (Qur’an / Hadith) in lighter, secondary text

**Tech constraints:**

* Astro component
* TailwindCSS only
* No animations unless extremely subtle
* Accessibility and readability first

**Your task:**

* Style **only this single component**
* Improve layout, spacing, and hierarchy
* Keep code clean and reusable
* Do NOT redesign the whole site

**Component to style:**

```astro
// paste component here
```

If Islamic text is needed, use **authentic, respectful wording** and include translations and sources when appropriate.
